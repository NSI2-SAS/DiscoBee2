# DiscoBee2

DiscoBee2 is a free and non-commercial NDI discovery server developed by NSI2 Consulting SAS and based on DiscoBee by ByteHive. It is intended as a drop-in replacement for the discovery server distributed with the official NDI SDK. DiscoBee2 adds explicit domain filters that limit which NDI sources are visible to listeners and exports Prometheus metrics for monitoring.

## Features

- Web interface showing all NDI sources registered on the discovery server
- Source grouping and access control defined in `config.yml`
- Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/metrics` exposing source status
- Simple REST API for querying sources

## Requirements

To run DiscoBee2 from source you need:

- **Node.js**
- **npm**
- **git**
- **curl**

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`start.sh` is intended for use with an external configuration repository; adapt it to your own workflow if needed.

### Configuration

Edit `config.yml` and define one or more filters:

- `range`: subnet of the source (CIDR notation)
- `name`: label shown on the web page
- `default`: `share` or `block` to control the default visibility
- `authorized`: list of subnets permitted to see the source

### Systemd service

Create a `startup.sh` script that launches `start.sh`, then add a systemd unit:

```
[Unit]
Description=NDI Discovery Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash /home/user/startup.sh
Restart=always
User=user
Group=user
WorkingDirectory=/home/user

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## API

- `GET /api/sources` â€“ list all available sources
